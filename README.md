## Assume Superuser Privileges

User Accounts
● Accounts represent users and services in Linux.
● User accounts have attributes like passwords, group memberships, comments, etc.
● Three types of accounts: root (superuser), standard user, and service accounts.

<h2> Superuser</h2>
● Root account serves as the local administrator and security context for some 
applications.
● Logging in directly as the root user is discouraged due to its extensive privileges.
● "Principle of Least Privilege" suggests giving users the minimum necessary access for 
their tasks.

The su Command
● Used to switch between user identities, allowing users to act as root.
● The su - command launches a new shell as the target user.
● The syntax is su [-] [user name].
The sudo Command
● Delegates specific commands to users, avoiding granting full root privileges.

● The syntax is sudo [options] {command}.
The sudoedit Command
● Enables users to edit files with their credentials, even if the file requires root privileges.
● Must be configured in the /etc/sudoers file.
● The syntax is sudoedit [options] {file name}.
The visudo Command
● Used to edit the /etc/sudoers file securely to avoid syntax errors.
● Syntax: visudo [options].
The wheel Group
● Many Linux distributions disable the root account for users and grant administrative 
privileges through the wheel group.
● Members of the wheel group can use sudo to perform administrative tasks.
● Membership in the wheel group should be carefully controlled.
