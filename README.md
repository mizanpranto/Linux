  <summary>Managing Users and Groups</summary>
  
## Assume Superuser Privileges

<h3> User Accounts </h3>

● Accounts represent users and services in Linux. <br>
● User accounts have attributes like passwords, group memberships, comments, etc.<br>
● Three types of accounts: root (superuser), standard user, and service accounts.<br>

<h3> Superuser</h3>

● Root account serves as the local administrator and security context for some applications. <br>
● Logging in directly as the root user is discouraged due to its extensive privileges.<br>
● "Principle of Least Privilege" suggests giving users the minimum necessary access for their tasks. <br>

<h3> The su Command </h3>

● Used to switch between user identities, allowing users to act as root.
● The <b> su - </b> command launches a new shell as the target user.
● The syntax is <b> su [-] [user name] </b>.

<h3> The sudo Command </h3>

● Delegates specific commands to users, avoiding granting full root privileges.
● Configuration is done in the /etc/sudoers file using the visudo editor.
● The syntax is sudo [options] {command}.

The sudoedit Command
● Enables users to edit files with their credentials, even if the file requires root privileges.
● Must be configured in the /etc/sudoers file.
● The syntax is sudoedit [options] {file name}.
The visudo Command
● Used to edit the /etc/sudoers file securely to avoid syntax errors.
● Syntax: visudo [options].
The wheel Group
● Many Linux distributions disable the root account for users and grant administrative 
privileges through the wheel group.
● Members of the wheel group can use sudo to perform administrative tasks.
● Membership in the wheel group should be carefully controlled.
